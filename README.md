# GUSEK_MILP_CodeGenerator
 Uses Java to generate a GUSEK MILP model to solve a origin destination matrix estimation problem (ODME) in a small to medium sized network.
 Its motivation was a paper released in 2014: "A generalized sensor location model for the estimation of network originâ€“destination" by Shou-Ren Hu and Han-Tsung Liou.

This code was made in the first half of 2016 for a UTFPR Curitiba subject.
